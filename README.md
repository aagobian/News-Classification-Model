# News Classification Deep Learning Model

This project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify news articles as real or fake.  
It was built with Python and PyTorch and trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles.  
The model achieves about **96% accuracy**.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses text data (tokenization, lemmatization, etc.)
- Uses word embeddings and vectorization for feature extraction
- Trains a neural network with PyTorch for text classification
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, and recall

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
